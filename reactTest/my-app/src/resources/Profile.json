        "About": "My name is Sigurður Helgason. I'm a student at Reykjavik University currently finishing my last semester in the Research Based Computer Science program. I finished my matriculation exam at the Tækniskólinn í Reykjavík from the School of Information Technology prior to starting my studies at Reykjavik University. I'm a very driven individual who enjoys learning new things. My interest in computer science began at an early age and I have been realizing that interest through my studies. Now that my degree is coming to a close and I have some project experience, I am eager to start to apply my new skills in industry."
